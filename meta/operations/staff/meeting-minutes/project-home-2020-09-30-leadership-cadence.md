## Goals <a id="id-2020-09-30LeadershipCadence-Goals"></a>

* Discuss PDAP focus

## Discussion Notes <a id="id-2020-09-30LeadershipCadence-DiscussionNotes"></a>

* Reevaluate current situation
  * If we consider what we know now, what would we have changed coming into the project?
    * We had good momentum, would be good to know better way to keep it going
    * Being able to dig down into objectives quickly in order to orchestrate goals
      * We focused too heavily on leadership right away, when maybe objectives would be higher priority
    * A lot personal learnings for some
      * Being given direction for a few of us would have taken us pretty far, and perhaps for a lot of other volunteers. A lot of us didn’t know what we needed to do, and we did lack a structure with deadlines because of decentralization
      * Being able to scope to focus in on goals and targets
    * Decentralized nature of the project makes it important to centralize information; a lot of relevant dialogue/information exchange occurs that gets lost
      * Will help with folks taking on things when they know where to look for it
    * Volunteers that had longevity be given the longer term stuff
      * People would come in and overtask themselves and become overwhelmed
      * Some volunteers have high expectations and want to be told what to do
      * Folks wanted to come into the project to reap the “glory” and when it wasn’t panning out, they fell off
    * Stanford Ignite didn’t quite have the impact we expected it to, and we put too much stock in it
