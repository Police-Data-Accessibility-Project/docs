# Password Management

#### What’s the policy?

The following must be true for all services: 

1. Eddie Brown \(Board Chair\) has top-level "admin" or "owner" access.
2. At least 3 people from the PDAP team \(defined by Discord account\) have admin or owner access, to the extent it’s possible. “Admin or owner access” confers the ability to manage users/members, and billing.
