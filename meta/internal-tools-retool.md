# Internal Tools (Retool)

We use Retool for "internal" tooling, such as **submission approval** and **data labeling.**

#### **Why Retool?**

Building a front end app takes time and effort we don't want to spend unless it needs to look nice or we know _exactly_ what we want. Retool is great for prototyping workflows, before they are solidified into a self-hosted web app.

#### **What are "internal" tasks?**

* A task which requires a higher level of context, trust, or access
* A task which is meant to support our users or mission
