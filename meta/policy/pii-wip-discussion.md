# PII (WIP / Discussion)

## Problem

We want people to feel sound ethically and legally when they contribute to PDAP. To that end, we need to do these things:&#x20;

1. Draw a “bright line” between the source material and the published data; i.e. “we are not changing the data, we are a mirror”. **\[a]**&#x20;
2. Avoid aggregating already-public PII in a way that would make it more public than it already is **\[b]**.
3. Strive for our stated mission **\[c]** of being a complete source of truth. i.e. “we could not be accused of editorializing by omission”. Our current policy is that we're allowed to collect PII **\[d]** .&#x20;

Our existing policy about _accepting_ PII is legally the right one but we do need to discuss how we _aggregate_ and _omit_. Discuss in the thread for the next 3 days, then we'll do a survey or something.&#x20;

### How sure are we that omitting PII is against the rules?

We have a policy that allows PII, **do we need to require it? Do we need to allow censorship?**

**Is PDAP the one doing the scraping, or the scraper community?**

We can always get a second opinion. Maybe we need to define what PII is?

**How can we prevent PDAP from being mugshots.com?**

**Can we choose which data we aggregate?** Sounds reasonable to Eddie.

Richard says there could be a security/`know-your-user` layer—make it more difficult than a search bar. Require people to register, know your user.

PDAP could be considered a wikipedia-like source of good sources.
