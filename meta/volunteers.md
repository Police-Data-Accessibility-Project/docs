# Volunteers

## Intake process

Volunteers join the Slack, where they are welcomed by a GreetBot message. It points them to the primary onboarding doc.

Don’t be shy if you have a way to push us in the direction of our goal: a source of truth for police data. The knowledge you share will make better tools.
