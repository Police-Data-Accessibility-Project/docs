* [ ] Make an issue in the [Data Sources Mirror](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-mirror/) repo describing what you did, and tag a dev so they know to make the same changes there.
* [ ] Make an issue in the [Django version](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/django-demo-compose) repo describing what you did, and tag a dev so they know to make the same changes there.
