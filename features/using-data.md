# Search the PDAP database

This is our core feature, and will always be open to everyone.

Our database **makes it easier to find existing data**, enhancing our ability to answer questions and complete research projects about police systems. Ask a question → **search for data** → analyze and report.

## Search tips

* **Expect missing data.** Most of our data is passively collected based on the needs and interests of our users. If you're looking for a specific record from a small town, we probably don't have it documented yet. Make a request and we'll help you out!
* **Use the** [**Record Types taxonomy**](../about/data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy.md) to understand how we categorize things.

## Searching with API

You can also [use our API](broken-reference) to browse the database.
