# Data Storage

### Where is the data kept?

#### Current storage methods

We don’t yet have much data, so we’re using Google Drive. All data is in the [ingestion dropbox](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jq0kF9sDzYfE47uxiwzdmDZySun4pVrw?usp=sharing), meaning it needs to be processed before it’s safe for public consumption.
