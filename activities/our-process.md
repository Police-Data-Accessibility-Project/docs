# Our Process

## What we're doing

### Right now

We're finding [sources of criminal justice data](data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/) in a database/library/index. As our archive grows over time, we can empower larger and more exciting analysis projects with the data we've collected.

### In the future

[Here's our immediate roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17). Here are our broad, [long-term milestones](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/planning/milestones?direction=asc\&sort=due\_date\&state=open).

## Phases of Data Accessibility in each state

1. Collect information about agencies and public data laws for each state in the U.S.
2. Collect required data about every criminal justice agency in the state, so people can see which agencies are relevant for any location.
   * Location
   * Jurisdiction
   * Parent / child relationships between agencies
3. Collect metadata about available Data Sources for each agency, so people can find information about any agency.
   * Type of records available
   * How to access the data
4. Publish tools to normalize and combine local data from different Agencies and States.
