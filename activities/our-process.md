# Our Process

## What we're doing

### Right now

We're cataloguing [sources of criminal justice data](data-sources/) in a database/library/index. As our archive grows over time, we can empower larger and more exciting analysis projects with the data we've collected.

### In the future

[Here's our immediate roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17). Here are our broad, [long-term milestones](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/planning/milestones?direction=asc\&sort=due\_date\&state=open).

## The investigative process

The PDAP team and volunteers work together to answer questions and learn about the police.

1. Ask a question or make a hypothesis about the police. For example, "how do police misconduct settlements affect local budgets?" If you'd like to see what other people think or get help, you can post in [#data-exchange in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/828274060034965575/1006564024894378106).
2. Find out whether public records can help you answer this question, and where those records may be located. You may find what you need in our [Data Sources](data-sources/); you may need to find them and create the Data Sources yourself.
3. Download, export, or scrape the records you need. [Read more about how PDAP approaches scraping here](data-scraping-and-extractions/).
4. Parse, analyze, and re-contextualize the results. Share your process in Discord, so we can learn and improve our processes together!

## Phases of Data Accessibility in each state

1. Collect information about agencies and public data laws for each state in the U.S.
2. Collect required data about every criminal justice agency in the state, so people can see which agencies are relevant for any location.
   * Location
   * Jurisdiction
   * Parent / child relationships between agencies
3. Collect metadata about available Data Sources for each agency, so people can find information about any agency.
   * Type of records available
   * How to access the data
4. Publish tools to normalize and combine local data from different Agencies and States.
