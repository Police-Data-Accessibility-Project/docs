# What we're doing

### Right now

We're cataloguing [sources of criminal legal system data](data-sources/) in a database/library/index. As our archive grows over time, we can empower larger and more exciting analysis projects with the data we've collected.

### In the future

We're making tools to help people share data with each other. [Here's our immediate roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17). Here are our broad, [long-term milestones](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/planning/milestones?direction=asc\&sort=due\_date\&state=open).

## Defining Public Records Accessibility

### Where are we focused first?

Because most data is consumed by local users—and because context is everything—we're focusing on helping people access as much information about their local municipality, county, or state as possible.

### What are public records?

Some information is required by law to be public. Governments keep several types of public records, and make them available to different degrees—sometimes on a web page, sometimes behind a "records request" process like the Freedom of Information or Right to Know requests. Our goal is to track these Data Sources in one place, and work to make each of them as accessible as possible.

#### Degrees of access for public records

1. The source should exist, but we have no known path to access it.
2. We can point to direct access to the Data Source.
3. We can point to direct access to a broader time range for the Data Source.
4. We can point to at least one stable historic archive of the Data Source.
