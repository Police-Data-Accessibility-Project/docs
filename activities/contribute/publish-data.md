# Publish data

If you have documents or data you need to publish, there are a few ways to go! Make sure to [**share your published data when you're done**](submit-data-sources.md).

* [JKAN](https://jkan.io/) (for smaller agencies) and [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) (for larger ones) are two open-source data portals which need to be set up by someone with some technical skills.
* DocumentCloud can be used for publishing PDFs, and has additional tools for recognizing text (OCR) and annotation. You will need to [request verification](https://airtable.com/shrZrgdmuOwW0ZLPM) to publish documents.
* Your town or region may have an open data portal ([here's Pittsburgh's](http://www.wprdc.org/)) which may be interested in publishing the data you have.
* A service like [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) can be used to share folders of documents in bulk, with fewer tools for keeping them organized or labeled.
