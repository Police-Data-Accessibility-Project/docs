# Data Source annotation

We're training a machine learning algorithm to [identify Data Sources](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-source-identification).

Part of NLP is "annotating" or "labeling" data to train the algorithm. The more labeled data we have, the better the algorithm will be able to tell us when it's relevant.

[This is the Doccano project](http://35.90.222.49:8000/projects/1). Reach out to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io) if you'd like access.

#### Content warning

This content contains annotations related to the criminal legal system, which may include discussions of topics such as crime, legal proceedings, incarceration, and violence. Additionally, part of our work is labeling websites which do not pertain to the criminal legal system but may appear related. _It's ok to take a break, or do something else._
