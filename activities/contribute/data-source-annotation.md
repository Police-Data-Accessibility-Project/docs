# Data Source labeling

## Why we're here

Annotating Data Sources helps us train a machine learning algorithm tasked with **finding as many useful sources of data as possible.** Useful data about police, courts, and jails are hidden in plain sight, and we're trying to build a library so it can be found and used on demand.

### How to start

Reach out to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io) or [use this volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ).

1. Review the URL and the information displayed.&#x20;
2. Decide whether the URL is generally **"relevant"** to police, courts, and jails. If there's not enough information presented, select **"incomplete info".**
3. If "yes", select a **"hierarchy level"**, referencing the examples on the page.
4. If it's a "parent", Choose a **"record type"**, referencing the [record types taxonomy](../data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy.md) as needed.
5. When you have finished, select "Submit". If you are unsure, you can always "Skip". All labels are human-reviewed, and checked for agreement with other annotators.

#### Content warning

This content contains annotations related to the criminal legal system, which may include discussions of topics such as crime, legal proceedings, incarceration, and violence. Additionally, part of our work is labeling websites which do not pertain to the criminal legal system but may appear related. _It's ok to take a break, or do something else._

## Admin: adding new annotators

1. In Label Studio, from PDAP's organization settings, add the member via email.
2. Once they accept, add them to the appropriate project.
