# Data Source annotation

## Why we're here

Annotating Data Sources helps us train a machine learning algorithm tasked with **finding as many useful sources of data as possible.** Useful data about police, courts, and jails are hidden in plain sight, and we're trying to build a library so it can be found and used on demand.

### How to start

Reach out to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io) or [use this volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ).

1. Review the URL and the information displayed.&#x20;
2. Decide whether the URL is generally **"relevant"** to police, courts, and jails.
3. Select a **"hierarchy level"**, referencing the examples on the page.
4. Choose a **"record type"**, referencing the [record types taxonomy](../data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy.md) as needed.

#### Content warning

This content contains annotations related to the criminal legal system, which may include discussions of topics such as crime, legal proceedings, incarceration, and violence. Additionally, part of our work is labeling websites which do not pertain to the criminal legal system but may appear related. _It's ok to take a break, or do something else._

#### Resources

Check out the [Record Types taxonomy](../data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy.md) for a better idea of what each one means.
