| scraper extraction        | The result of running a Scraper is an extraction, usually intended to further parse or process an HTML page or PDF into more usable data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| metadata                  | Packaged with data (like a Data Source or scraper extraction), metadata is information about when and how the data was collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| data custody / provenance | <p>Who collected and published the data?</p><p></p><p><code>agency_described</code> (which agency is the data about?)</p><p><code>originating_entity</code> (who generated the records?)</p><p><code>supplying</code>_<code>entity</code> (who is publishing the records?)</p><p></p><p>Sometimes these are all the same entity; sometimes they are all different.</p>                              |
