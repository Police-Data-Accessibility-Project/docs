# Submit Data Sources

## Introduction

Every police agency has one or many Data Sources, or URLs which hold data about the agency.

### Quick start

1. Head to the [Data Sources repo](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/data\_sources) to see which datasets we already have.&#x20;
2. Find a web page on the agency site with potentially useful data.
3. Add your Data Source to the database with [web tools](submit-datasets-with-web-tools.md) or the [CLI](submit-datasets-with-cli.md).
