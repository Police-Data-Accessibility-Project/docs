# Validate Data Sources PRs

1. Navigate to DoltHub, where data PRs are submitted. Pull Requests are made to the Datasets repo by the community here: [https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/data\_sources/pulls](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/pulls)
2. Use the [Datasets Submission Checker scripts](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-app/blob/main/utilities/Datasets%20Submission%20Checker/README.md) on the data in the Pull Request, and post your results as a comment! The submitter will either improve their submission or remove the problematic rows.
