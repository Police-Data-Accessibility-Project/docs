# Labeling events

## Goals of each event

* Train a small group on data labeling
* Add as many data sources to the database as we can
* Set people up to label on their own time
* Refine our data labeling tools

## Structure of activities

### In advance

1. Participants RSVP to the event, held on Discord or in-person.
2. Participants create a PDAP account and are sent invites to the Retool organization.
3. Organizers give participants the appropriate permissions in the back-end.
4. If anyone has location or subject matter interests, organizers give them instructions for following the appropriate search.

### At the event

1. Organizers welcome participants and kick off popcorn-style introductions.
2. Organizers screen-share the process of:
   1. selecting a batch
   2. labeling for relevancy
   3. labeling for record type
   4. labeling for agency
3. Organizers open the floor for questions.
4. Participants are encouraged to begin labeling, and are free to ask questions about specific labels or parts of the process as they come up.
5. Labeling continues for an hour; participants are encouraged to continue after the event at their own pace.
6. Organizers use the Final Review screen to approve or adjust labels in real-time, giving feedback as necessary.
