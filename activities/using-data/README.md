Our database enhances our ability to answer questions and complete research projects about police systems. Ask a question →  locate records → process records into data → analyze and report.

## Why is this important?

People need to be able to find data to do anything with it. The foundation of our work is creating a common system for classifying and tracking public data.&#x20;

### Things we can build using our Data Sources database

* **Automatic archives** of each URL, creating a lasting resource for future research and web scraping. As it stands, information is lost to time due to data retention policies.
* **Shared progress.** When data is liberated, we want to tell people so they don't spend time trying to collect the same stuff.
* **Better transparency.** We're demonstrating the limits of the data that's already published, and addressing them one by one.
* **Unlimited others:** if you are working on the criminal legal system, better data could probably help.
