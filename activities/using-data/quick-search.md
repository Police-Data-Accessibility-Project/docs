The most basic way to find what you need in our database is to search our simple form: `what` are you looking for, `from where`?

## Tips

* **Use generic search terms.** We track places on the internet where data is found, not individual records. If you want to find a police record of a bike accident on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, CA, you might want to start by searching for `accidents` in `Pooler`, not `bicycle accident` at `1234 Rogers St`.
* **Expect missing data.** Most of our data is passively collected based on the needs and interests of our users. If you're looking for a specific record from a small town, we probably don't have it. Make a request and we'll help you out!
* **Use "all" or state names to broaden your search.** We might have what you're looking for by a different name, or in a different region.
* **Use the** [**Record Types taxonomy**](../data-dictionaries/record-types-taxonomy.md) to understand how we categorize things.
