## What is a Data Source?

A Data Source is a web page, file, database, or filing cabinet somewhere which contains records about a criminal legal system agency (law enforcement, courts, corrections). Often, they are published by the agency itself. Many more records are hidden behind records request processes.

Data Sources can be records describing an agency's activities, like **traffic stops** or **use of force policies**. They describe agencies in the criminal legal system like the `Pittsburgh Bureau of Police` or `Allegheny County Jail`.

If it's about a police, court, or jail system, we want to track it. This includes FOIA'd documents, web URLs, and independently scraped records.
