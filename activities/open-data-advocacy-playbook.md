# Advocate for open data

## How to advocate for open data in your area

{% hint style="info" %}
You can positively impact your local systems by becoming an expert on your local data ecosystem, and pushing for more transparency.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Identify transparency allies and people already using data about police systems.

This could be city council members, journalists, activists, public defenders, researchers, municipal employees, or residents with a question to answer.&#x20;

You can also [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ) to find other people doing similar work.

### 2. Find out what kind of data would be topical/useful.&#x20;

A community can have different priorities at any given timeâ€”is everyone talking about traffic stop policy? Would better access to court case data answer several questions at once?

### 3. Find out where local data could be improved.

Is anything missing, like properties that would make the data more useful? Are there records which should be published, but aren't? You can use our database to help keep track, [make a search](../features/using-data.md), and [submit data sources](submit-data-sources.md).

### 4. Uncover reasons why data is not currently published

Publishing data requires time, money, and expertise. Understanding opposition to open data will help sharpen your strategy, and help your local government to be more transparent. Is someone already responsible for open data where you live? Their perspective is invaluable.

### 5. Challenge barriers to open data

This could involve making a [FOIA request](foia.md), [writing a web scraper](web-scraping.md), or including [language about open data](https://phila.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5007829\&GUID=33E8CA43-B311-4219-A5A5-BBE600D14D55\&Options=ID%7CText%7C) in legislation.

* Do [any other agencies](https://data-sources.pdap.io) publish useful data? If they can do it in `neighboring town`, why not here?
* Does your town already have an [open data ordinance](https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/cis/ProposedPittsburghOpenDataOrdinance.pdf) which requires publishing this data?
