# Data Scraping & Extractions

## Current status

We're still in the iteration and case study phase. If you want to learn something about the police, you can write a scraper to parse, normalize, or get deeper information from our Data Sources.

If you don't have scraping skills, you can use our Discord to find someone who may be able to help.

1. Run a Scraper you wrote, or one from the [Scrapers Repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers), to get an extraction.
2. Share your extraction and what you learned in Discord. We'll work with you to write and publish a case study.
3. We'll all learn about the criminal justice system from the experience, and brainstorm ways our tools could better facilitate your work.
4. Repeat!

## Requirements for published Extractions

* We always need to know **when** Extractions were collected.
* We need to know **which code** was used to Scrape the Extraction.
* We need to know from **which Data Source** the data was Extracted.

Since we have git version control on our scrapers, we can audit any Extraction to understand how it was gathered.
