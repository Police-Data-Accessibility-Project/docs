# Find new Data Sources

## Quick start

If you found a good source of data, you can [submit it to our database](https://pdap.io/data-source/create)!

## Finding data in your area

Checking to see what data is currently published in your area is a great way to move our project forward, one city at a time.

1. [Search for your chosen agency or area](https://pdap.io) in our database.
2. Search the agency homepage and related sites for data about the agency. When you find one, make a new [Submit Data Sources form](https://airtable.com/app473MWXVJVaD7Es/shrJafakrcmTxHU2i) submission.
3. Fill in the form for each valuable data source. This should take 1–5 minutes, and you will get faster as you go!

## Submitting bulk data

If you already have several of Data Sources in a spreadsheet—maybe from a previous project, or because you collected them in bulk—you can submit them to us in any format.

1. Head to the existing [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D) and download a CSV to get the most recent format. This will help us import and approve your Data Sources more quickly.
2. Submit spreadsheets to the "[Submit bulk Data Sources or Agencies](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D)" form.

## Inaccuracies & missing options

If you discover a mistake or missing agency, you can email [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io) and we'll correct the data.
