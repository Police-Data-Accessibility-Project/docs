# Label new Data Sources

## Why we're here

Labeling potential Data Sources helps us make a more complete database!  Our source collectors crawl the internet using a variety of strategies, and volunteers catalogue the sources they find. One day, we may also be able to train [machine learning models](https://huggingface.co/PDAP) to identify useful data.

### How to start

Reach out to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io) or [use this volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ) with "data labeling" selected. We'll give you instructions for accessing the labeling interface!

#### Content warning

This content contains annotations related to the criminal legal system, which may include discussions of topics such as crime, legal proceedings, incarceration, and violence. Additionally, part of our work is labeling websites which do not pertain to the criminal legal system but may appear related. _It's ok to take a break, or do something else._
