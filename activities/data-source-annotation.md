# Label potential Data Sources

## Why we're here

Annotating Data Sources helps us train [machine learning models](https://huggingface.co/PDAP) to **identify useful data.** Useful data about police, courts, and jails are hidden in plain sight, and we're trying to build a library so it can be found and used on demand.

### How to start

Reach out to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io) or [use this volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ) with "data labeling" selected. We'll give you instructions for accessing the labeling interface!

#### Content warning

This content contains annotations related to the criminal legal system, which may include discussions of topics such as crime, legal proceedings, incarceration, and violence. Additionally, part of our work is labeling websites which do not pertain to the criminal legal system but may appear related. _It's ok to take a break, or do something else._
