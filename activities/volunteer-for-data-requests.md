# Volunteer for Data Requests

## Context

When people need help with a data project, they can [fill out our request form](https://pdap.io/).

### GitHub

Communication about open Data Requests happens on GitHub Issues. We recommend you make a free account! You don't need to know anything about code or open source to leave comments in GitHub.

## Sign up as a volunteer

If you want to help but aren't sure where to start, you can sign up as a volunteer. PDAP staff will reach out when requests for data come in! Head to the [volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ).

## Finding open Data Requests

* From [pdap.io](https://pdap.io), make a search for a geographic area. At the bottom of the search results, note the "Requests" section.
* You can also find [all open requests here](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/26).
* If you want to contribute, leave a comment on any request's GitHub Issue.
