  It helps us understand which data is available, and which is not.

# Data Sources

## What is a Data Source?

An internet URL where public data about the police can be found. This could include budgets, court records, personnel information, and more.

### What we want to know about each Data Source

* What kind of data can be found there?
* Where is it located?
  * Is the data right there on the page? Do we need to download a file?
* How can it be accessed?
  * Do users need any skills? Who can download it?
* What format is it in?
