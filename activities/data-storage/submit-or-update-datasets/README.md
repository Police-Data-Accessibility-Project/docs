  The Data Sources database is the critical foundation of the rest of our work.
  It helps us understand which data is available, and which is not.

# Data Sources

## What is a Data Source?

A web page, file, database, or even stack of paper somewhere that contains information about the police system. Governments keep several types of public records, and share them to different degrees: internally, externally, or not at all.

Our goal is to track these Data Sources in one place, and work to make each of them as accessible as possible.

### What we want to know about each Data Source

* What kind of data can be found there?
* Where is it located?
* How can it be accessed?
* What format is it in?
