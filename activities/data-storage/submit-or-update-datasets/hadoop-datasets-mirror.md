# PostgreSQL Datasets mirror

## Why would I use this?

A data scraper may not want to install DoltHub just to use the [Datasets repo](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets). DoltHub may conflict with other processes, or you may prefer to access an HDFS with Python. Accessing it as a more straightforward read-only file system is useful for some scrapers.

## How does it work?

`hadoop-worker-1` is configured on a Digital Ocean droplet. It makes a mirror of the [Datasets db in Dolthub](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/datasets) every time a merge is made.
