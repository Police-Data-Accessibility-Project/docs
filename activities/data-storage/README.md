# Published Data

Archival, verifiable, and secure data storage is a key mission deliverable.

1. An archive of [Data Sources](submit-or-update-datasets/), preserving valuable information and allowing it to be scraped more easily. This raw archive is the cornerstone of our ability to audit any data we publish.
2. An archive of Extractions, managed by the PDAP community. Volunteers can contribute with Scraping, machine learning, ETL, and manual processing to make the source material more useful. _This is where_ [_PII is removed_](../../meta/policy/pii-wip-discussion.md)_._
