# FOIA Requests

### What are FOIA requests?

[The Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom\_of\_Information\_Act\_\(United\_States\)) (FOIA, pronounced FOYA) has created the springboard for citizens to request data from any level of government. Not all documentation can be disclosed with the public, but FOIA Requests are the place to start.

### Can I help by making requests?

If you have successfully made a FOIA request through a service like Muckrock, we may be able to use the URL of the completed request as a [Data Source](../submit-or-update-datasets/).
