# Data Extractions

## Current status

We're still in the iteration and case study phase. To submit data:&#x20;

1. Run an approved Scraper from the [Scrapers Repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers) to get an Extraction.
2. Share your Extraction in Discord. We'll work with you to write and publish a case study.
3. We'll work with data consumers to understand how we're doing.
4. When we have learned from case studies, we'll solidify the process.

## Requirements for published Extractions

* We always need to know **when** Extractions were collected.
* We need to know **which code** was used to Scrape the Extraction.
* We need to know from **which Data Source** the data was Extracted.

Since we have git version control on our scrapers, we can audit any Extraction to understand how it was gathered.
