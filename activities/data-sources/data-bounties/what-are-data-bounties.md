# What are Data Bounties?

Data Bounties are limited-time events where we set a monetary reward for the collection of data for a specific goal. Members of the PDAP community are paid based on the quantity and quality of the data they submit to our database. The end result is a dataset that can be used by anyone.

Our [first data bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/bounties/3c259649-762e-438b-a538-b14be4d0507a) created a database of every police department in the country.

## How do bounties work?

These are powered and sometimes outright sponsored by DoltHub. We pay for each cell of data submitted, and spread the bounty out based on how much each person contributed.
