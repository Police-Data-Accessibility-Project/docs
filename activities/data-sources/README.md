# Data Sources

## What is a Data Source?

A web page, file, database, or even stack of paper somewhere that contains information about the police system. Governments keep several types of public records, and share them to different degrees: internally, externally, or not at all.

Our goal is to track these Data Sources in one place, and work to make each of them as accessible as possible.

### Data custody

Often, an agency will keep their own records and publish their own data. Sometimes, agencies will work with a third party, like a contract, to publish the data. We're also interested in collecting data where the record-keeper is a third party researcher or agency.
