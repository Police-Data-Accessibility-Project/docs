## The investigative process

The PDAP team and volunteers work together to answer questions and learn about the police through public criminal legal system records. Our core functions are highlightedâ€”our community is there to support with the rest.

1. **Ask a question** or make a hypothesis about the police. For example, "how do police misconduct settlements affect local budgets?" This is the "Why?" of our work.
2. **Locate public records** to help you answer this question. You may find what you need in our working Data Sources database.
3. <mark style="background-color:yellow;"><mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Access the records**<mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark> <mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark><mark style="background-color:yellow;"><mark style="background-color:yellow;">however you can. We're making archives of internet sources, and helping people share their successful FOIA requests.<mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>
4. **Use scrapers,** if needed, to parse or process records into usable data. [Read more about how PDAP approaches scraping here](../data-scraping/).
5. **Analyze and report** the results. Share your process in Discord, so we can learn and improve our processes together!
