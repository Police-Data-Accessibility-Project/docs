# Request data

## Get help from the PDAP community

Here is our [data request form](https://airtable.com/shrbFfWk6fjzGnNsk). You can reach us at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io) if you have questions about this process.

## The investigative process

The PDAP team and volunteers work together to answer questions and learn about the police through public criminal legal system records.

1. **Ask a question** or make a hypothesis about the police. For example, "how do police misconduct settlements affect local budgets?" This is the "Why?" of our work.
2. **Locate public records** to help you answer this question. You may find what you need in our working [Data Sources database](explore-data-sources.md).
3. **Access the records** however you can. Typically this happens via the internet or a [public records request](foia.md).
4. **Use scrapers,** if needed, to parse or process records into usable data. [Read more about how PDAP approaches scraping here](../data-scraping/).
5. **Analyze and report** the results. Share your process in Discord, so we can learn and improve our processes together!
