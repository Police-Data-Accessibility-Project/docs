# Agency submission

Police Agencies are government-run entities responsible for administering some part of the criminal justice system: **law enforcement, courts, and corrections**. Our mission is specific to police (law enforcement) but understanding that data typically requires context found in court and corrections systems.

## Submit an Agency

If you know of a police agency but can't find it in our [Agencies table](https://airtable.com/shr43ihbyM8DDkKx4/tblpnd3ei5SlibcCX), you can submit it using the ["Submit an Agency" form](https://airtable.com/shrzxLdSsYmBvIWMH).

## Editing Agencies

To make bulk changes, you can use the "[Submit bulk Agencies or Data Sources](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D)" form. We'll merge your changes using the `airtable_uid` property.
