# Data Source submission

You don't need to know how to code to do this! However, feel free to write scripts or tools to help you in your work. If you make something super-useful, consider sharing it back with the community!

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're not sure where to start, pick a city, county, or state that means something to you. Make it a goal to find all potential Data Sources for that area.
{% endhint %}

## Quick start

[Here's the form](https://airtable.com/shrJafakrcmTxHU2i).

## Tutorial: Individual Data Sources

This process should take 1–5 minutes per source, depending on the source and how quick you are with a keyboard.

1. [Pick an agency](https://airtable.com/shr43ihbyM8DDkKx4/tblpnd3ei5SlibcCX) to focus on; it may be the one in your hometown, or the school police from your university.
2. Check to see whether there are already Data Sources for the agency you're working on by using filters in the [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrUAtA8qYasEaepI/tblx8XaKnFTphWNQM). It's early—chances are, we haven't made it to your agency yet!
3. Find Data Sources to submit. These are commonly found on police, court, or corrections agency websites. You can find examples in the [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrUAtA8qYasEaepI).
4. Open the ["Submit Data Sources" form](https://airtable.com/shrJafakrcmTxHU2i).
5. Fill in as much info as you can. Only the fields marked with a \* are required, but more information is better.
6. To protect us all from spam and rudeness, only approved submissions are published. Our team reviews these at least weekly.
7. Find as many Data Sources as you can from your chosen agency, and repeat!

## Bulk (10+) Data Sources

If you already have several of Data Sources in a spreadsheet—maybe from a previous project, or because you collected them in bulk—you can submit them to us in any format.

1. Check to see whether there are already Data Sources for the agency you're working on.
2. Optionally, head to the existing [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D) and download a CSV to get the most recent format. This will help us import and approve your Data Sources more quickly.
3. Submit your spreadsheet to the ["Submit Bulk Data Sources" form](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D).

## Editing Data Sources

If you discover an inaccuracy, you can reach out in Discord or use the Bulk Upload Form to correct the record.

1. Head to the [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrUAtA8qYasEaepI).
2. Use the triple-dot button in the menu bar to `Download CSV`.
3. Open the CSV in the tool of your choice—Excel, Google Sheets, or a dedicated CSV editor.
4. Remove all the rows but the ones you want to change.
5. Save the CSV and upload it to the Bulk Data Sources form above.

We'll import the CSV and make sure the changes are reflected appropriately.
