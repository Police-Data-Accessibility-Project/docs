# Example: a Data Source in the wild

* The agency's homepage is [https://www.alamedaca.gov/Departments/Police-Department](https://www.alamedaca.gov/Departments/Police-Department). As it contains information about staff and contact information, it is itself a Data Source.
* On the sidebar they have a button to **Review Crime Activity.** This particular page gives us at least 5 different data sources.
