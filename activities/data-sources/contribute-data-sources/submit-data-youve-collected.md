# Submit data you've collected

If you've collected criminal justice data that isn't currently published on the internet, you can add yourself to our Data Sources table!&#x20;

In the event that someone wants to use data you've provided, you can give instructions for how you should be contacted. PDAP can also serve as a go-between to protect your identity.

## How to start

[Just submit this form](https://airtable.com/shr6StxK9zgVzgGCy)!

If you have questions about submitting Data Sources in general, [start here](data-source-submission.md).
