# Data Source Annotation

We're training a machine learning algorithm to [identify Data Sources](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-source-identification).

Part of NLP is "annotating" or "labeling" data to train the algorithm. The more labeled data we have, the better the algorithm will be able to tell us when it's relevant.
