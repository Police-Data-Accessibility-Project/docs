# Data Source submission forms

You don't need to know how to code to do this! However, feel free to write scripts or tools to help you in your work. If you make something super-useful, consider sharing it back with the community!

## Individual Data Sources

1. Check to see whether there are already Data Sources for the agency you're working on.&#x20;
2. Open the ["Submit Data Sources" form](https://airtable.com/shrJafakrcmTxHU2i).
3. Fill in as much info as you can. Only the fields marked with a \* are required, but more information is always better.
4. To protect us all from spam and rudeness, only approved submissions are published. Our team reviews these at least weekly.
5. If you have questions or concerns with the approval process or anything else, reach out in Discord or email [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).

## Bulk (10+) Data Sources

If you already have several of Data Sources in a spreadsheet—maybe from a previous project, or because you collected them in bulk—you can submit them to us in any format.

1. Check to see whether there are already Data Sources for the agency you're working on.
2. Optionally, head to the existing [Data Sources table](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D) and download a CSV to get the most recent format. This will help us import and approve your Data Sources more quickly.
3. Submit your spreadsheet to the ["Submit Bulk Data Sources" form](https://airtable.com/shrbnadIQyefJhI1D).

## Edits

If you discover an inaccuracy, please reach out in Discord or [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io). We're handling correction of these issues internally for the moment, to focus as much effort as possible on growing our database.
