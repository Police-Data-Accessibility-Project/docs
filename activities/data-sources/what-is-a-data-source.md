# What is a Data Source?

## What is a Data Source?

A web page, file, database, or filing cabinet full of files somewhere which contains information about the police system.

### Public Records

Some information is required by law to be public. Governments keep several types of public records, and make them available to different degrees.

Our goal is to track these Data Sources in one place, and work to make each of them as accessible as possible.

### Data custody

It's important to know who collected and published the data.&#x20;

`agency` → `record-keeper` → `publisher`

Sometimes these are all the same entity; sometimes they are all different. No matter what, we want to track the Data Source.
