# What is a Data Source?

## What is a Data Source?

A web page, file, database, or filing cabinet somewhere which contains records about a criminal justice agency (law enforcement, courts, corrections). Often, this is published by the agency itself.

#### Example

Data Sources are records describing an agency's activities, like `arrest records` or `hiring policies`.

Agencies are criminal justice organizations, like the `Pittsburgh Bureau of Police` or `Allegheny County Jail`.

## Why is this important?

People need to be able to find data to do anything with it. The foundation of our work is creating a common system for classifying and tracking public data. Does your organization have a giant, unwieldy spreadsheet tracking FOIA requests and web sites? [You're not alone](../share-data/contribute-data-sources.md#spreadsheet-of-data-sources).

### Things we can build using a Data Sources database

* **Automatic archives** of each URL, creating a lasting resource for future research and web scraping. As it stands, information is lost to time due to data retention policies.
* **A classification system** using metadata about which records are available, how it was collected, and how it relates to other records. This is the path to doing big, complicated aggregation projects.
* **Better transparency.** We can improve transparency by being a hub for people who are using what's already there, finding its limits, and addressing them one by one.
* **Shared tools.** When someone finds a Data Source in our database, they will also be able to see associated scrapers, extractions, and archives.

### What kinds of Data Sources are best?

If it's about a criminal justice agency, we want to track it. This includes FOIA'd documents, web URLs, and independently scraped records.
