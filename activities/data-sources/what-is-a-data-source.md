# What is a Data Source?

## What is a Data Source?

A web page, file, database, or filing cabinet full of files somewhere which contains information about a criminal justice agency (law enforcement, courts, corrections). Often, this is published by the agency itself.

## Why is this important?

Shouldn't we just be writing a bunch of web scrapers and getting down to business? The short answer is that people are already doing this—across the country, people are using whatever means they can, from Python bootcamps to machine learning, to analyze what data is available.

* People need to be able to find data to do anything with it. This is currently a challenge. Does your organization have a giant, unwieldy spreadsheet with URLs pasted into it? [You're not alone](contribute-data-sources/data-source-submission.md#spreadsheet-of-data-sources).
* If we have a database of Data Sources, we can systematically archive each one and begin to create a lasting resource for future research and web scraping. As it stands, information is lost to time due to data retention policies.
* Data is next to useless at scale without context; we need to capture information about what data is available, how it was collected, and how it relates to other data. Only then will our community be able to effectively analyze and meaningfully compare it.
* Most people don’t realize how inconsistent police data access can be. We need to communicate that many sources of data that should be public have not been published, and serve as a hub for transparency activists working on the problem.

## Public Records Accessibility

### What are public records?

Some information is required by law to be public. Governments keep several types of public records, and make them available to different degrees—sometimes on a web page, sometimes behind a "records request" process like the Freedom of Information or Right to Know requests. Our goal is to track these Data Sources in one place, and work to make each of them as accessible as possible.

#### Degrees of access for public records

1. The source should exist, but we have no known path to access
2. Someone has previously made an extraction or records request for this source
3. We have custody of an archive or can point to direct access

## Data custody

It's important to know who collected and published the data.&#x20;

agency described (which agency is the data about?)

↓

originating entity (who generated the records?)

↓

supplying entity (who is publishing the records?)

Sometimes these are all the same entity; sometimes they are all different. No matter what, we want to track the Data Source.
