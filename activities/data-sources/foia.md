# FOIA Requests

### What are FOIA requests?

[The Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom\_of\_Information\_Act\_\(United\_States\)) (FOIA, pronounced "FOYA") has created the springboard for residents to request data from any level of government. Not all documentation can be disclosed with the public, but FOIA Requests are the place to start.

### Can I help by making requests?

If you have successfully made a FOIA request through a service like Muckrock (or put the results online in some other way), the URL of the completed request is a valuable data source. [Submit it here](../share-data/contribute-data-sources.md#submit-data-youve-collected), and the community will thank you!
