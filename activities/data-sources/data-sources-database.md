# Data Sources Database

Our Data Sources are maintained with various front-end tools, but they live in Supabase.

## Overview

We regularly [mirror our database](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-mirror) from Airtable, where it is managed, to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). We use [an API generated from this database](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-app) to access and use Data Sources.
