## What we do

We're making an open-source toolkit for transparency-minded people who use data about police systems in their work. To start, we're cataloguing [sources of data](broken-reference) in a database so people can find data about their local systems.

Everyone is welcome in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or our email inbox at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).

[Here's our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).
