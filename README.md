## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We're serving the community of people using police data for their work. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keep the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## Get involved

### Specific ways to help

#### Collect Data Sources or submit records you have [FOIA requested](activities/data-sources/foia.md) or [scraped](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md)

We need help from anyone who can use a computer to contribute to our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md).

#### Write a scraper

If you find data you'd like to collect or preserve, make it happen! Start by reading [our approach to scraping](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md), and reach out if you need help or guidance. If your strategy for scraping is successful, we'll share it as a case study to help people working on similar projects.

#### Donate

[Start here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). We're a non-profit, so your donations may be tax-deductible.

#### Join our community

Participate in the information ecosystem! Give feedback and share what you know [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ).

#### Use our Data

[Here's our process](activities/our-process.md). We're in the early daysâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies!

### Use Discord Roles!

If you don't see a way to help right now, you can sign up to be notified when we need help in the future! Head to the [#welcome channel in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/828274060034965575/828286370023735296/890016942323277914) and react with an emoji to the areas where you can help.&#x20;
