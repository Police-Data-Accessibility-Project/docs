## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We're serving the community of people using police data for their work. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keep the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## How to get involved

### [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ)

This is where we collaborate! Even if you don't have time to volunteer, you can give feedback and share what you know. Participate in our information ecosystem!

You can use Discord roles to **sign up to be notified when we need help** in the future. Head to the [#welcome channel](https://discord.com/channels/828274060034965575/828286370023735296/890016942323277914) and react with an emoji to the areas where you can help.

### Other ways to help

#### Collect Data Sources or submit records you have [FOIA requested](activities/data-sources/foia.md) or [scraped](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md)

We need help from anyone who can use a computer to contribute to our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md).

#### Write a scraper

If you find data you'd like to collect or preserve, make it happen! Start by reading [our approach to scraping](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md), and reach out if you need help or guidance. If your strategy for scraping is successful, we'll share it as a case study to help people working on similar projects.

#### Donate

[Start here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). We're a non-profit, so your donations may be tax-deductible.

#### Use our Data

[Here's our process](activities/our-process.md). We're in the early daysâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies!
