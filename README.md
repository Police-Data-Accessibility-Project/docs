## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We're serving the community of people using police data for their work. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keep the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## Get involved

### Primary focus: collecting Data Sources

We need help from anyone who can use a computer to contribute to our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/data-sources/contribute-data-sources.md).

### Other ways to help

You can share data our community, and add yourself as a Data Source. [Start here](activities/data-sources/contribute-data-sources.md#submit-data-youve-collected).

#### Donate
