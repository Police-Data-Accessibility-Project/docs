## What we do

We're cataloguing sources of data in a database so people can find information about local police systems. [This is our app](https://data-sources.pdap.io). [Here's our app roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).

Everyone is welcome in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or our email inbox at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).
