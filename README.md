# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PDAP!

Read more about our mission at [https://pdap.io/](https://pdap.io/).

## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keeps the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## Get involved

### Our primary focus: collecting Data Sources

{% hint style="info" %}
You can read about why this is our focus [here](activities/our-process.md).
{% endhint %}

Anyone with basic computer skills can help build our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/).

### Other ways to help

* People with any level of criminal justice related experience can give feedback and serve as a sounding board [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ).
* Anyone with a network of trusted friends and collaborators can text, email, or DM our website to a friend who might be able to contribute.

#### Want to code?

* You can use your scripting and automation skills to help us [bring our Agencies and Data Sources up to date](activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/).
* Coders of any experience level can [write data scrapers](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)...and more importantly, use them! Python is our preferred language; ultimately, use what makes you happy.

#### Use our Data

If you have a question you'd like to answer about the police, reach out to contact@pdap.io or in Discord. Our community of experts of volunteers may be able to help you. We're in the early days, and don't have much published yetâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies.
