## What we do

We're cataloguing sources of data in a database at [**https://pdap.io**](https://pdap.io) so people can find information about local police systems. [Here's our app roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).

## Codebase

[Our github organization](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project) contains our code repositories. We have a handful of apps working in conjunction to identify, collect, document, archive, and share sources of data.

### Primary repositories

* The [Data Sources App repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-app) is the back end for our Data Sources API.&#x20;
* The [pdap.io repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/pdap.io/) is our primary interface for working with the API.
* The [Data Source Identification repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-source-identification) houses our code for collecting sources for the database.
