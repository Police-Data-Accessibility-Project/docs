## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keeps the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## Get involved

### Primary focus: collecting Data Sources

We need help from anyone who can use a computer to contribute to our database of Data Sources.  [Start here](activities/data-sources/contribute-data-sources/data-source-submission.md).

### Other ways to help

#### Submit public data you've collected

You can share the results of your hard work with our community, and add yourself as a Data Source. [Start here](activities/data-sources/contribute-data-sources/submit-data-youve-collected.md).

#### Join our community

Participate in the information ecosystem! People with relevant experience can give feedback and serve as a sounding board [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or by [booking time to talk](https://calendly.com/pdap-josh/30min).

Anyone with a network of trusted friends and collaborators can text, email, or DM our website to a friend who might be able to contribute.

#### Want to code?

You can use your scripting and automation skills to help us [bring our Agencies and Data Sources up to date](activities/data-sources/).

Coders of any experience level can [write data scrapers](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)...and more importantly, share the results! This works best if you're trying to answer a question or do something you think is useful. Python is our preferred language; ultimately, use what makes you happy.

#### Use our Data

[Explore Data Sources here](activities/data-sources/explore-data-sources.md).

If you have a question you'd like to answer about the police, reach out to [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io) or in [Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). Our community of experts of volunteers may be able to help you. We're in the early daysâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies.
