## How do we work?

We're a rotating cast of volunteers with a flat organizational structure. The core PDAP staff keep the lights on and allow our community to move the mission forward, step by step.

## Get involved

{% hint style="info" %}
We're a learning organization, and **we want to hear from you.** If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or expertise, reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cn2ZpVTdw7) or to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io).

### Non-code volunteering

* Anyone with basic computer skills can help build our database of [Data Sources](activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/).
* People with any level of criminal justice related experience can give feedback and serve as a sounding board in Discord.
* Anyone with a network of trusted friends and collaborators can text, email, or DM our website to a friend who might be able to contribute.

### Code volunteering

* We welcome help from coders of any experience level to [write data scrapers](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Python is our preferred language; ultimately, use what makes you happy.

### Use our Data

If you have a question you'd like to answer about the police, reach out to contact@pdap.io or in Discord. Our community of experts of volunteers may be able to help you. We're in the early days, and don't have much published yetâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies.
