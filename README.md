# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

## Thank you for being here!

Most of us are here because we were trying to answer a basic question about our local police, and came up short. We're keeping track of of [data sources](activities/terms-and-definitions/what-is-a-data-source.md) about every agency in the United States, and building a [machine learning pipeline to find more](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-source-identification).

Everyone is welcome in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or our email inbox at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).

[Here's our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).
