## What we do

We're cataloguing sources of data in a database so people can find information about local police systems.

Everyone is welcome in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or our email inbox at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).

[Here's our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).

## Get Involved

### People with a question about a police system

* [Check our database](https://pdap.io/data) to see if we have something you need.
* If you could use support answering your question, [request help here](broken-reference).

### Volunteer (code, data, scraping, FOIA, etc)

[Start at our GitHub org here](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project). You can also read more about [scraping](activities/contribute/web-scraping/) and [FOIA](activities/contribute/foia.md).&#x20;

### Donors
