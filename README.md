## What we do

We're cataloguing sources of data in a database at [**https://pdap.io**](https://pdap.io) so people can find information about local police systems.

## Get Involved

At any time, [use the volunteer form](https://airtable.com/appcYa6x4nS7W8IR3/shrk9c5sBsBr3cdJJ) to be connected to a project. Use the "Activities" menu on the left to see guides for common volunteer tasks.

To support us financially, [you can donate here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). We're a non-profit, so your donations may be tax-deductible.

## Codebase

To contribute code, [start with a Good First Issue](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/25/views/1).

[Our github organization](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project) contains our code repositories. We have a handful of apps working in conjunction to identify, collect, document, archive, and share sources of data.

### Primary repositories

* The [Data Sources App repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-sources-app) is the back end for our Data Sources API.&#x20;
* The [Data Source Identification repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/data-source-identification) houses our code for collecting sources for the database.
* The [pdap.io repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/pdap.io/) is our primary front end for working with the API.
