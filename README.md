## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. The core PDAP staff keeps the lights on, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## Get involved

### Primary task: collecting Data Sources

Anyone with basic computer skills can help build our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/).

### Helping without code

* People with any level of criminal justice related experience can give feedback and serve as a sounding board in Discord.
* Anyone with a network of trusted friends and collaborators can text, email, or DM our website to a friend who might be able to contribute.

### Helping with code

* The foundation of scraping efforts is a great database of agencies and their sources; if you don't have a specific question you're trying to answer, you can use your scripting and automation skills to help us [bring our database up to date](activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/).
* We welcome help from coders of any experience level to [write data scrapers](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)...and more importantly, use them! Python is our preferred language; ultimately, use what makes you happy.

### Use our Data

If you have a question you'd like to answer about the police, reach out to contact@pdap.io or in Discord. Our community of experts of volunteers may be able to help you. We're in the early days, and don't have much published yetâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies.
