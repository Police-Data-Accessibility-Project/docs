## What we do

We're making an open-source toolkit for transparency-minded people who use data about police systems in their work. To start, we're cataloguing [sources of data](activities/data-sources/) in a database so people can find data about their local systems.

### Plans for the future

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/24https:/github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/24)
* [High-level diagram of our in-progress ecosystem](https://www.figma.com/file/19axhLZb0ejtlOWSFZcNAc/High-level-technical-diagram?type=whiteboard\&node-id=0%3A1\&t=Q51wVP3gfK4aSlED-1)

## How to get involved

### Volunteer

[Fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrBSE6cnuvLQtJF1) if you're good with data, or persistent enough to do research and investigation online. We'll pair volunteers with open projects and open data requests.

#### Writing scrapers

If you find data you'd like to collect or preserve, make it happen! Start by reading [our approach to scraping](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md), and reach out if you need help or guidance.

### Use our data

You can [browse our data sources here](activities/data-sources/explore-data-sources.md). If you need help of any kind, [start here](activities/data-sources/request-data.md).

### Donate

[Start here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). We're a non-profit, so your donations may be tax-deductible.
