## What we do

We're cataloguing sources of data in a database so people can find information about local police systems. [Here's our app roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/21/views/2).

## Codebase

[Our github org](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project) contains our code repositories. We have a handful of apps working in conjunction to identify, collect, document, archive, and share sources of data.
