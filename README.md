## How do we work?

We're a small but growing multidisciplinary community of transparency-minded people. We're serving the community of people using police data for their work. We meet [in Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ). The core PDAP staff keep the lights on, the non-profit board empowers our work, and the broader community moves the mission forward step by step.

## How to get involved

### Volunteer your skills for data requests

[Fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrBSE6cnuvLQtJF1) if you're good with data, or persistent enough to do research and investigation online. We'll pair volunteers with data requestors.

### Find Data Sources

We need help from anyone who can use a computer to contribute to our database of Data Sources. [Start here](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md).

### Share data you've collected

If you have FOIA'd or scraped data in the past, you can [list yourself as a Data Source here](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md#submit-data-youve-collected).

### Other ways to help

#### Label data for our machine learning pipeline

If you have access to a computer and can use a web browser, you can help label data to train our machine learning algorithm! Even an hour of your time helps. Reach out to [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io) if you'd like to help.

**Find related open-source projects**

There are lots of DIY projects like [this one](https://github.com/openpolicedata/openpolicedata) and [this one](https://github.com/ayyubibrahimi/eos) which are based on agency-published data. Find an interesting one, and test it outâ€”if it works, you can [submit it as a Data Source](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md#submit-individual-data-sources). You can signal-boost the projects you like, and you may even find one in need of contributors!

#### Write a scraper

If you find data you'd like to collect or preserve, make it happen! Start by reading [our approach to scraping](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md), and reach out if you need help or guidance. If your strategy for scraping is successful, we'll share it as a case study to help people working on similar projects. If you can't think of anything to scrape yourself, find local groups working on the criminal legal system. They probably have data woes! Reach out if you need a hand.

#### Donate

[Start here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). We're a non-profit, so your donations may be tax-deductible.

#### Use our Data

[Here's our process](activities/our-process.md). We're in the early daysâ€”your project could be one of our first case studies!
