## How do we work?

We're a rotating cast of volunteers with a flat organizational structure. The core PDAP staff keep the lights on and allow our community to move the mission forward, step by step.

We're a learning organization, and **we want to hear from you.** If you have questions, concerns, suggestions, or expertise, reach out in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cn2ZpVTdw7) or to [operations@pdap.io](mailto:operations@pdap.io).
