## What we do

We're making an open-source toolkit for transparency-minded people who use data about police systems in their work. To start, we're cataloguing [sources of data](activities/data-sources/) in a database so people can find data about their local systems.

### Plans for the future

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/24https:/github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/24)
* [High-level diagram of our in-progress ecosystem](https://www.figma.com/file/19axhLZb0ejtlOWSFZcNAc/High-level-technical-diagram?type=whiteboard\&node-id=0%3A1\&t=Q51wVP3gfK4aSlED-1)

### Our investigative process

1. **Ask a question** or make a hypothesis about the police. For example, "how do police misconduct settlements affect local budgets?" This is the "Why?" of our work. All research begins with a question.
2. **Locate public records** to help you answer this question. You may find what you need in our working [Data Sources database](activities/data-sources/explore-data-sources.md), through your own research, or by [requesting data from our community](activities/data-sources/request-data.md).
3. **Process records into usable data**, using code if needed. [Read more about how PDAP approaches web scraping here](activities/data-scraping/).
4. **Analyze and report** the results. Share your process in Discord, so we can learn and improve our processes together!

## Get involved

Everyone is welcome in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ), or email inbox at [contact@pdap.io](mailto:contact@pdap.io).

### Journalists, Activists, Researchers, and other data users

* Use the data we're already tracking in [our Data Sources database](activities/data-sources/explore-data-sources.md) to answer questions about our most critical systems. What are the causes and effects of increased transparency?
* If you find something new and useful, share it with us [using our submission form](activities/share-data/contribute-data-sources.md).&#x20;
* To get our community's help answering important questions, [request help here](activities/data-sources/request-data.md).

### Data Volunteers & Web Scrapers

* We pair volunteers with open community data requests. [Fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrS4PAZTYVT1zSq8) if you're a persistent researcher, good with data, or interested in web scraping.
* You can read more about [our approach to scraping here](activities/data-scraping/our-approach-to-scraping.md).

### Code Volunteers

* You can contribute Python or Vue code toward our software objectives. Find a [good first issue to work on here](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/25/views/1), or check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/24/views/1).
