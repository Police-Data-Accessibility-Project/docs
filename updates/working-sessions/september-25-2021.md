* We have credit + accounts with Microsoft Azure, so Alec is working on learning their system and processes.
  * First project is getting our Splunk instance up.
  * Second project might be a mirror of the dolt datasets repo. We [already have one](../../activities/submit-or-update-datasets/hadoop-datasets-mirror.md) but are interested in experimenting.
* [community.club](https://www.community.club/) is an interesting resource.
* [Seed Club](https://club.mirror.xyz/) is an incubator we should keep an eye on.
