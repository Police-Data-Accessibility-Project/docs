* Mitch has been working on [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) and abstracting it to pass in SQL query results...this can work with DoltHub or future databases.
  * SQL → Django → ChartJS
  * This will be useful for **communicating our status** on a public page.
* Bounty: key learning is that flat-fee bounties incentivize easily machine-scraped data, and disincentivize manual collection. For the next bounty, we'll do `datasets` only and see how far we get with manual effort.
* App: Stabs made a great utility to create scrapers; we need to get it pointing at the scrapers database and running it in browser. Ideally that gets folded into our Django app as well. We can release a local version, too.
