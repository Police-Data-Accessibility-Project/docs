# 5/26/21: Dolt Bounty Start

As of 13:31 (PST) / 16:31 (EST), our Dolt Bounty is officially live! Anyone who adds data into the `datasets` table will get $0.33 per row (maximum cap is $5,000 for the entire bounty). The bounty is running until July 7th @ 1500 (PST) / 1800 (EST)! You can find more information [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/bounties/3c259649-762e-438b-a538-b14be4d0507a) about the bounty.

* Only Dolt bounty related PRs can be approved (so we cannot make our own commits or PRs to master for the next 6 weeks)
* **Only Katie (Dolt Team) can make the PR approvals on the `pdap/datasets` repo during the active bounty** (she needs to use a special internal framework to attribute credit to the bounties)
* If we  to do any schema changes or PRs, we will have to create a separate branch and hold all the changes there. **It cannot be merged into master until the bounty is over**
* It will be very beneficial to have us monitor the #data-bounties channel in their Discord. If they have any questions about our dataset, it will help us understand how to improve.
