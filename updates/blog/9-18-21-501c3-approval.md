# 9/18/21: 501c3 Approval

## We did it!

In January, we filed for 501c3 status with the IRS. On August 14, 2021, it was accepted! Police Data Accessibility Project Inc is now a registered nonprofit. [Here's our guidestar profile](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/85-4207132). 

The biggest change is that your donations may be tax deductible!

## What's next?

### Fundraising

We're volunteer-based, but we want to hire a skeleton crew to keep the lights on. We're [on Techsoup](https://www.techsoup.org/OrganizationProfile?mode=display&orgId=2179703), so we can access lots of software at free or reduced rates. We're now a more attractive recipient for grants and large donations.

If you believe in our mission and want to contribute, [start here](https://pdap.io/contribute.html). Text a few people you're close with, too!

### Product

We're working on removing roadblocks to data activists \(scrapers\), and giving them a place to put their unprocessed data. 

Once there's a place for the raw data, we need to make submission as seamless as possible with a **local app**. Our [roadmap is here](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/17) if you'd like to read more or contribute code.
