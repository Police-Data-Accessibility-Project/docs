# 6/2/21: Bounty Update 3

* Our first dolt bounty PR for `agencies` has been accepted with over 68,000 edits!!
* Katie (Dolt) has a bash script that currently that clones the repo and will check for whitespaces, duplicates and some general domain keyword searching to ensure someone is not passing a fake URL just to get an edit count.
  * She will turn it into a python script with unit-testing, and also fledge it out for checking datasets as well. This script will be useful for us also as we can use it as part of our own pipeline for PR verification in the future!
