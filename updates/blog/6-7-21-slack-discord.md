# 6/7/21: Slack → Discord

For a variety of reasons, we have decided to archive our old Slack channel and merge with our [existing Discord](https://discord.gg/wMqex8nKZJ)! There was no need to have two messaging channels for the same project, this consolidates into one. While some Slack features—such as threads—will be missed, the much-more-used Discord will be a fantastic new home. We will be spending the next few days making adjustments to make the community more welcoming and help guide new users through this new experience!
