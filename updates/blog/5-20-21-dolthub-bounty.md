# 5/20/21: DoltHub Bounty

Volunteers gather or "scrape" data for PDAP, but we're running [a 6-week data bounty](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-05-28-bounty-announcement-with-pdap/) generously sponsored by Dolt. The bounty pays people to gather traceable, approved data. Since we can focus effort by putting a price on specific data, we're able to get a massive head start on our Dataset Catalogue.

From there, we'll be able to scale and consolidate our [scraping efforts](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers) into an app that can be run to gather data from any dataset. Every time a scraper is run, we add more [data to the database](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/data-intake)!

The current bounty will get us a list of URLs for thousands of police agencies on our Agencies and Datasets tables. [Read more about it here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/bounties/3c259649-762e-438b-a538-b14be4d0507a).
