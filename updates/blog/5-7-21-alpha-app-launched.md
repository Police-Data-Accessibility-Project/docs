# 5/7/21: Alpha App Launched

We published a [Django app](https://app.pdap.io/map) that shows a map of the US and when you click a state, it will show all the agencies on the map. Right now, it connects to a PostgreSQL instance using static Dolt data. Future plans:

* getting a sync from dolt for the data
* fleding it out to show more information about the current statuses / datasets for each agnecy
* having a way to download the data easily
* spruce up the intake tools to aid in importing data into Dolt
* spruce up the UI (probably align with our Gatsby front-end framework)
