## Updates from PDAP

We've submitted for grant renewal from Heinz, and are actively seeking additional sources of funding.

We're getting a slow and steady flow of `requests` and `volunteer offers` via the forms on our [front page](https://pdap.io).

### Open projects

* We need a jail roster scraper for Allegheny County, to help local folks investigate who's being kept in the county jail, and for how long.
* Our friends at Big Local News are looking for help scraping some data about officer-involved shootings from California. We're trying to cover [23 agencies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f\_qWiXWTcAsUNMtOQlrv0sYG4hgLfVGzupVH3Ek12Z0/edit#gid=0).
* We're using machine learning to identify data sources. We have an algorithm, and need to generate more training data for the next iteration.
