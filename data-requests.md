# Data Requests

Using data to answer questions is a multi-disciplinary process.

Data Requests are a major way our community can find each other and collaborate toward shared goals. They can be as simple as "I'm looking for some missing data" or as open-ended as "I'm beginning a research project and could use advice".

## Opening a Request

There are buttons littered around the homepage, search, and map for opening a new request if data is missing.

When a new Request is created, it goes into an approval queue for moderation.

Once a Request is approved, a GitHub issue is automatically created and [added to this project](https://github.com/orgs/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/projects/26).&#x20;

We use GitHub to organize and work Requests for a few reasons:

* it has built-in project management and discussion features we now don't have to make ourselves
* many data-skilled folks have a GitHub account and it's free to create one
* we feel right at home in GitHub as an open-source project
* Requests are kept anonymous by default, but are open for collaboration and the requestor can sign up for notifications.

## Working on Requests

See our [volunteer guide for data requests](activities/volunteer-for-data-requests.md).
