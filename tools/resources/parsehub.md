# Parsehub

Any Scraping done for PDAP's database of Extractions must be open source. This means scraping is generally done from scratch or with open source libraries, with everything [kept in our repo](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers).&#x20;

However, the Datasets table is a resource, not useful by itself. This means Datasets can be collected and submitted with or without a Scraper in our repo. [Read more here](../../activities/data-storage/submit-or-update-datasets/examples-best-practices.md).
